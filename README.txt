= Is there anyway of displaying event details within the content of the post? =

[sse_start_date], [sse_end_date] , [sse_location], [sse_time]

= I am getting 404 pages when I go to a event page, how do I fix this? =

This is an issue with WordPress code and registering custom post types. The url rewrite engine doesn't recognise the url. A work around is to go to Settings > permalinks and press save changes. Just by saving changes, it will flush the rewrite rules and events should display.
